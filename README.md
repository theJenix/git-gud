# git-gud
Praise the sun

This is a silly little app that runs like a git command, and punishes you like a From Software game.

To use:

* add git-gud to your executable path
* run git gud
* traverse the fog

To play:

You are in the fight for your life!  A large knight or beast (on the roadmap) or beast knight (also on the roadmap) is charging toward you with murderous intent.  You have to react, and react quick!

On each turn, you'll see an randomly selected action prompt and will be able to attack, dodge, or parry.  Each enemy action has a right move, a neutral move, and a wrong move.  Pick the right move and you will do one point of damage to the enemy and can potentially stun them -- A stunned enemy will not fight back, so you can get a free hit in on the next turn.  Pick a neutral move and it will move to the next turn.  Pick the wrong move and you die.  The turns are timed with a hidden clock: if you fail to take an action in time, you die.  And, as the fight goes on, it gets more intense, so the time to make a move decreases.

In a fashion typical of a From Software game, the first time you face an enemy you will likely get wrecked fast.  As you learn their moves, though, you will eventually git gud, and victory will be achieved.
